A proof of concept for Cloudflare Pages.

My current workflow involves an SSG (Hugo) deployed (via a Makefile) to an S3 (at Scaleway), together with Cloudflare workers for an associated api. All, of course, fronted by Cloudflare and it's handy caching. So, interested to see how this can all be integrated into Cloudflare's Pages offering ðŸ˜Ž

This repo contains the source code for a (Hugo generated) JAMstack. Documentation is available for:

-   [Development](./docs/development.md)

For general Hugo related documentation see the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

As an exercise in "Eating your own dog food", this guide will be published using the resulting site too! See [Cloudflare Pages PoC](./content/posts/cloudflare-pages-poc/index.en.md))

## Note

I use YAML rather than TOML.
